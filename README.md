### project overview

### objectives
this investiges the root pf delays in the oil tranfer process and proposes a strategic solution plan,though data analysis of operational work and process.

### scope
- current transfer and handlink protocols
- staffing and equipement
- service delay patterns

 ### methology
  - data collection,gatherind,staffing data,equipement,and servives
  - Analysis:identifying delay en corrrelating with operational factors
  - root cause analysis:diagnotic main delay contributors.

  ### DATA SOURCE
  data set provided by the client as csv file,which was dowloaded and processed for aalysis.

  ### TOOls
- microssoft excell:utilised for prliminary data correction and initial review of dataset.
- SQLserver:employed for data cleaning and in-depth analysis to extract meaningfil insigths.
- POWER BI:used to visualize insights and provide details,interractive reports.

  ### Exploratory data analisis (EDA)
  IN this EDA phase,we will examine th human resource dataset to address key operational questions that can impact the efficiency and reliability of oil transfert which will help identify potentiel areas for improvement and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
  Key question to address:
  1. Total number of truck DRivers
  * Determine the nuber of trucks drivers to access if current stffing meets operational demands.
 2. Number of efficient trucks
  * Identify the count of trucks classified as efficient to understand fleet reliability and potential operational operational constraints.
 3. Coverage Areas ( Distences in Kilometers)
  * analiyze distances corvered to evaluate the geographic reach  and the adequacy of logistical support accross ereas served.
